# Simulation Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The original `simulation.py` file (1133 lines) has been refactored into multiple, smaller, more focused modules for better maintainability and organization.

## New File Structure

### 1. `src/simulation/phase_manager.py`
**Purpose**: Utility functions for phase and action management
- `index_to_action()`: Convert action index to phase string
- `phase_to_index()`: Convert phase string to action index

### 2. `src/models/q_network.py`
**Purpose**: Neural network model for DQN
- `QNetwork` class: SKRL-compatible Q-network implementation
- Network architecture configuration
- Forward pass computation

### 3. `src/environment/traffic_light_env.py`
**Purpose**: Environment wrapper for SKRL integration
- `TrafficLightEnvironment` class: Interface between simulation and SKRL
- State/action space management
- Environment step functionality

### 4. `src/simulation/traffic_metrics.py`
**Purpose**: Traffic measurement and calculation utilities
- `TrafficMetrics` class with static methods for:
  - Travel delay calculation
  - Queue length measurement
  - Density computation
  - Waiting time assessment
  - Vehicle counting
  - Movement detection

### 5. `src/agents/skrl_agent_manager.py`
**Purpose**: SKRL agent setup and management
- `SKRLAgentManager` class: Centralized agent management
- Agent initialization and configuration
- Action selection with epsilon-greedy
- Memory management and experience storage
- Training coordination
- Model saving/loading

### 6. `src/simulation.py` (Refactored Main File)
**Purpose**: Core simulation logic
- `Simulation` class: Main simulation orchestrator
- Simplified by delegating responsibilities to specialized modules
- Focus on simulation flow and coordination
- Integration with SKRL agent manager

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Easier to understand and modify individual components
- Reduced coupling between different functionalities

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to navigate and debug
- Changes to one component are less likely to affect others
- Clearer code organization

### 3. **Enhanced Testability**
- Individual modules can be unit tested in isolation
- Easier to mock dependencies for testing
- More focused test scenarios

### 4. **Better Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other projects
- Traffic metrics can be used independently
- Agent manager can work with different environments

### 5. **Easier Collaboration**
- Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear module boundaries

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code
The refactored simulation maintains the same public interface, so existing code should continue to work without modifications:

```python
# This still works the same way
from src.simulation import Simulation

sim = Simulation(...)
sim.run(epsilon, episode)
```

### For New Development
You can now import and use individual components:

```python
# Use specific components
from src.models.q_network import QNetwork
from src.agents.skrl_agent_manager import SKRLAgentManager
from src.simulation.traffic_metrics import TrafficMetrics

# Or use the full simulation
from src.simulation import Simulation
```

## File Size Reduction
- **Original**: `simulation.py` - 1133 lines
- **Refactored Main**: `simulation.py` - ~680 lines
- **Supporting Modules**: ~450 lines total across 5 files

## Import Structure
Each module properly handles its dependencies with explicit path management to ensure reliable imports across the project structure.

## Backward Compatibility
All public interfaces remain unchanged, ensuring existing training scripts and tests continue to work without modification.
